# Before starting
{: #pag-requirements}

You need an [IBM Cloudâ„¢ Platform account](http://cloud.ibm.com/) to get started with PAG.

Before provisioning your {{site.data.keyword.pag_full}} (PAG) instance, you need to create the following resources in your PAG account. You need to have these when provisioning PAG using the UI or CLI.

- **IAM permissions**
   - PAG admin role
   - Viewer permission for {{site.data.keyword.vpc_full}}s (VPC) in the account (otherwise they will not be able to specify a VPC)
   - Viewer permission for the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full}} (COS) instances in the account (otherwise they will not be able to specify a COS)
- **VPC** - You need to create a VPC to contain the PAG instance.
- **VPC Subnet** - Required for the gateway host name to be selected. Subnets are created by default with a VPC, but you can create additional subnets as well. You will be asked during PAG provisioning to provide the CRN of the subnet that you want the PAG endpoint to reside.

For this release, you must have a public gateway accessible from the subnet that you select for PAG. This is needed for PAG to be able access the IBM IAM service from your gateway for authorization.
{: note}

- **COS instance and bucket** - An [instance of IBM Cloud Object Storage](http://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/cloud-object-storage) and bucket must be created to store your PAG session recordings. You will need to provide the COS instance and bucket name during PAG provisioning.
- **Run SSH key agent** - You must have the SSH key agent running on your local machine if you want to run a Secure Shell from the CLI.

## VPN setup
{: #pag-requirements-vpn-setup}

You need to setup your {{site.data.keyword.vpn_vpc_short}} so that you can run PAG CLI commands on your local machine to access the private gateway endpoint that will be created for you when PAG is provisioned.

Reference this [document](https://test.cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpn-overview) for details of how to set this up. You will be creating a VPN type of Client-to-Site, and for the VPC you had setup yourself in the previous section.

As described in the referenced {{site.data.keyword.vpn_vpc_short}} documentation, you will need to setup the OpenVPN client to connect to the VPC by downloading the client profile from the IBM cloud account's VPN as described [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpn-client-environment-setup).

You need to ensure that any security group connected to the VPN will pass ports 7200 through 7202. These ports are needed by the PAG CLI.

## SSH Key Agent
{: #pag-requirements-ssh-key-agent}

If you want to run a Secure Shell (SSH) using the CLI, you must start the SSH Key Agent on your local machine by executing the following command:

   ```sh
   $ eval ssh-agent
   ```
