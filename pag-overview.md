# What is Privileged Access Gateway (PAG)?
{: #pag-overview}

{{site.data.keyword.pag_full}} (PAG) is a managed service that is used to provide a secure way for operators to remotely administer servers and clusters within the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}. It does this by providing a Bastion gateway server, which is a single point of entry to a set of customer servers and clusters. In addition to this restricted gateway access, PAG records operator sessions, and these recordings can be used for investigations of system misuse.

PAG functions as a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy for comprising people, processes, and technology. It is used to control, monitor, secure, and audit all human and nonhuman privileged identities, and activities across an enterprise IT environment.
