# Security controls for Privileged Access Gateway (PAG)
{: #pag-security-controls}

This is where we would add different security controls that PAG allows, with reference to the standards number for the requirement, and how PAG implements it, and how the user can use it.

This is a catch all page that we can start small and add controls as we implement. May be only a very minimal set for Experimental release.
